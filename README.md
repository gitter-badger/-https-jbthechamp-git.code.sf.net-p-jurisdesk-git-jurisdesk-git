# Fork me on Github - I'm a professional web developer and card carrying Github Developer Program member. 
#- I specialize in SEO, Business Web Development, NGINX Wordpress Consulting, Server Consulting, Networking (although I claim to hate it, I can do some really "weird stuff" with DNS that will blow your mind away
# , E-Commerce and More.
#So why a readme for my github page? Because It's proper. I live by a small saying - "Don't do things Half Ass" - Not even a simple html5 page with no database, php, ruby, python (all programming languages I specialize in)
